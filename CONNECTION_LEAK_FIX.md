# SQLAlchemy Connection Leak Fix

## Problem Statement
SQLAlchemy was generating garbage collector warnings about non-checked-in connections:

```
The garbage collector is trying to clean up non-checked-in connection <AdaptedConnection <asyncpg.connection.Connection object at 0x7e609e091b80>>, which will be terminated. Please ensure that SQLAlchemy pooled connections are returned to the pool explicitly, either by calling ``close()`` or by using appropriate context managers to manage their lifecycle.
```

## Root Cause Analysis (Corrected)
**Initial Analysis Error**: The original fix incorrectly identified unused methods as the source of the issue. 

**Actual Root Cause**: The issue was in the `get_session_generator()` function in `chatter/utils/database.py`, which is heavily used throughout the FastAPI application as a dependency injection mechanism. The function had incomplete session cleanup logic in several scenarios:

1. **GeneratorExit handling**: When the generator was closed abruptly, only `session.expunge_all()` was called but the session was never closed
2. **Transaction cleanup**: When sessions were in transaction state, only `session.expunge_all()` was called but the session connection was never properly returned to the pool
3. **Exception handling**: Some exception paths would skip session cleanup entirely

### The Problem Pattern
```python
except GeneratorExit:
    # ... cleanup code ...
    session.expunge_all()  # ❌ Only expunged, never closed the session
    
# ... other exception handlers that didn't always close sessions
```

When sessions are not properly closed in all code paths, SQLAlchemy's connection pool tracking becomes inconsistent. Connections get checked out from the pool but are never returned, leading to connection leaks that the garbage collector eventually has to clean up.

## Solution
**Enhanced session cleanup in `get_session_generator()`** to ensure sessions are always properly closed in all code paths:

1. **GeneratorExit handler**: Now calls both `session.expunge_all()` AND `await session.close()`
2. **Exception handlers**: Now ensure `await session.close()` is called after rollback attempts
3. **Finally block**: Simplified and made more robust to always attempt session closure
4. **Transaction handling**: Sessions in transaction state are now rolled back AND closed

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `chatter/utils/database.py` - Enhanced session cleanup in `get_session_generator()`
- `tests/test_connection_leak_fix.py` - Updated test to verify proper cleanup logic

### Key Improvements
1. **Multiple session.close() calls** across different cleanup scenarios
2. **Proper GeneratorExit handling** with session closure
3. **Enhanced exception handling** that always attempts to close sessions
4. **Simplified finally block** with more robust cleanup logic

### Code Changes
- Added `await session.close()` in GeneratorExit handler
- Added `await session.close()` in general exception handler  
- Enhanced transaction cleanup to rollback AND close sessions
- Simplified the finally block cleanup logic

## Verification
- ✅ `get_session_generator()` function is extensively used throughout the FastAPI application
- ✅ Enhanced cleanup logic addresses all session lifecycle scenarios
- ✅ Multiple `session.close()` calls ensure connections are returned to pool
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing FastAPI dependency injection

## Proper Connection Usage Patterns

The `get_session_generator()` function is used automatically by FastAPI's dependency injection:

```python
# FastAPI endpoint (automatically uses get_session_generator)
@router.get("/example")
async def example_endpoint(
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session_generator)
):
    # Use session here - cleanup is handled automatically
    result = await session.execute(query)
    return result
```

For direct usage:
```python
# Direct usage (less common)
async for session in get_session_generator():
    # Use session here
    result = await session.execute(query)
    break  # Important: exit the generator properly
```

## Expected Outcome
The SQLAlchemy garbage collector warnings should now be eliminated since sessions are properly closed in all code paths, ensuring connections are returned to the pool appropriately.
