# Document Retrieval Fix - Summary

## Problem

Document retrieval during chat was not working - no documents were being retrieved during execution despite `enable_retrieval=True` being set.

## Root Cause

The system had a **data storage/retrieval mismatch**:

### Storage Side (Working Correctly)
- Documents were being processed and stored in the `document_chunks` table
- The `EmbeddingPipeline` uses `SimpleVectorStore` to write embeddings directly to `document_chunks`
- This table has columns: `document_id`, `content`, `chunk_index`, `embedding`, `raw_embedding`, `computed_embedding`, etc.

### Retrieval Side (Bug)
- The `get_vector_store_retriever()` function was creating a `PGVectorStore` using langchain-postgres
- Langchain-postgres creates and uses its own separate tables: `langchain_pg_collection` and `langchain_pg_embedding`
- These tables were **empty** because documents were never written to them
- The retriever was looking in the wrong place!

## Solution

Created a custom retriever (`DocumentChunkRetriever`) that queries the correct table:

### Key Changes

1. **chatter/core/custom_retriever.py** (NEW)
   - Custom retriever class that implements the langchain retriever interface
   - Uses `SimpleVectorStore.search_similar()` to query `document_chunks` directly
   - Supports user_id and document_ids filtering
   - Returns langchain-compatible `Document` objects

2. **chatter/core/vector_store.py**
   - Updated `get_vector_store_retriever()` to create and return `DocumentChunkRetriever`
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Removed dependency on langchain-postgres tables

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Added detailed logging in `RetrievalNode.execute()` to track retrieval flow
   - Added logging in `WorkflowGraphBuilder._create_nodes()` to track node creation
   - Added logging in LLM node to track when retrieval context is applied

### How It Works Now

1. User uploads document â†’ stored in `document_chunks` with embeddings
2. User sends chat with `enable_retrieval=True`
3. `get_vector_store_retriever()` creates `DocumentChunkRetriever`
4. Retriever is passed to workflow and set on `RetrievalNode`
5. When workflow executes:
   - `RetrievalNode` calls `retriever.ainvoke(query)`
   - `DocumentChunkRetriever` generates query embedding
   - Queries `document_chunks` using `SimpleVectorStore.search_similar()`
   - Returns relevant documents
6. LLM receives documents in system message context
7. LLM generates response using retrieved documents

## Testing

Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_document_retrieval_fix.py`:
- Test retriever initialization
- Test successful retrieval flow with mocked database
- Test error handling

## Migration Notes

**No migration required** - this is a pure code fix. Documents already in the database will work immediately with the new retriever.

## Future Considerations

If langchain-postgres integration is desired in the future, the solution would be to:
1. Either migrate all documents to langchain tables, OR
2. Update the embedding pipeline to write to both systems, OR
3. Keep using the custom retriever (recommended for simplicity)

The custom retriever approach is recommended because:
- Direct database access is more efficient
- We have full control over filtering and search logic
- No need to maintain two separate storage systems
- Consistent with the rest of the codebase
