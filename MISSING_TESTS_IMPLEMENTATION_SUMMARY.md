- Document to chat workflow
- User-agent interaction workflows
- Analytics across multiple services
- External service integration
- Cache service integration
- Error propagation and recovery
- Service dependencies and graceful degradation

## Key Features Implemented

### Graceful Degradation
All tests are designed to gracefully skip when endpoints are not available, rather than failing. This allows the test suite to run in various deployment states without breaking.

### Comprehensive Markers
All tests are properly marked with pytest markers:
- `@pytest.mark.e2e`
- `@pytest.mark.performance`
- `@pytest.mark.security`
- `@pytest.mark.contract`
- `@pytest.mark.database`
- `@pytest.mark.integration`

### Realistic Testing Scenarios
Tests simulate realistic user behavior and system usage patterns, not just basic functionality validation.

### Security-First Approach
Security tests cover the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and include both positive and negative test cases.

### Performance Monitoring
Performance tests include memory leak detection, response time consistency validation, and sustained load testing.

## Usage Examples

### Running Test Categories
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pytest -m e2e

# Run performance tests
pytest -m performance

# Run security tests  
pytest -m security

# Run database tests
pytest -m database

# Run contract tests
pytest -m contract

# Run integration tests
pytest -m integration

# Combine categories
pytest -m "performance or security"

# Exclude slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Mixed workload testing
locust -f tests/load/locust_scenarios.py MixedWorkloadUser --host=http://localhost:8000

# Heavy user testing
locust -f tests/load/locust_scenarios.py HeavyUser --host=http://localhost:8000

# Chat-focused testing
locust -f tests/load/locust_scenarios.py ChatLoadTestUser --host=http://localhost:8000
```
