## 2. Code Quality Assessment

### Current Issues Requiring Attention

**Linting Issues (Priority: High)**
Based on ruff analysis, several categories need attention:

1. **Documentation Issues**
   ```
   - D100: Missing docstring in public modules (47 instances)
   - D400: First line should end with a period (23 instances)
   - D212/D213: Multi-line summary formatting issues
   ```

2. **Code Cleanup**
   ```
   - ERA001: Commented-out code in alembic/env.py
   - INP001: Missing __init__.py files in alembic directory
   ```

3. **Exception Handling**
   ```
   - TRY003: Long exception messages should be extracted
   - EM101: Exception string literals should be variables
   ```

**Type Safety Issues (Priority: High)**
MyPy identified critical type annotation problems:

1. **Missing Type Annotations**
   - `cache_interface.py`: Functions missing argument/return types
   - `validation/`: Multiple files with incomplete type coverage
   - Several utility functions lack proper typing

2. **Type Compatibility Issues**
   - `validators.py`: List variance issues with ValidationError types
   - Generic type parameter specifications needed

### Code Quality Score: C+ (Needs Improvement)

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Fix all linting issues (estimated 4-6 hours)
2. Add comprehensive type annotations (estimated 8-12 hours)
3. Clean up commented code and add missing documentation
