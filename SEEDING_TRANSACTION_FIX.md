Database Seeding Transaction Fix

This document explains the fix for the PostgreSQL transaction abort error
that was occurring during database seeding operations.

## Problem

The original error was:
```
(sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.Error) <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.InFailedSQLTransactionError'>: 
current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
```

This error occurs when a PostgreSQL transaction encounters an error and gets marked as aborted, 
but subsequent SQL commands are attempted without properly handling the transaction state.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the transaction management within the seeding methods:

1. `_seed_development_data` calls `_seed_minimal_data`
2. `_seed_minimal_data` calls `_create_admin_user` 
3. If `_create_admin_user` fails for any reason (constraint violation, missing table, etc.)
4. The transaction gets aborted, but the error isn't properly caught and rolled back
5. When subsequent methods try to query the database, the transaction is still in aborted state
6. All further SQL commands fail with "current transaction is aborted"

## Solution

Added proper transaction management and error handling to all critical seeding methods:

### 1. _create_admin_user()
- Wrapped in try/catch block
- Calls `await self.session.rollback()` on any exception
- Returns existing user when found (instead of None)

### 2. _create_development_users()
- Wrapped in try/catch block  
- Calls `await self.session.rollback()` on any exception
- Properly handles list of users

### 3. _create_basic_registry()
- Wrapped in try/catch block
- Calls `await self.session.rollback()` on any exception
- Handles registry creation failures

### 4. _create_basic_profiles()
- Wrapped in try/catch block
- Calls `await self.session.rollback()` on any exception
- Handles profile creation failures

## Key Changes

1. **Transaction Rollback**: Each method now properly rolls back the transaction on error
2. **Error Propagation**: Exceptions are logged and re-raised after rollback
3. **State Recovery**: The session is left in a clean state for subsequent operations
4. **Return Value Fix**: `_create_admin_user` now returns the existing user when found

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- Database transactions are properly cleaned up on errors
- The session remains usable after an error occurs
- Seeding can continue or fail gracefully without leaving the database in an inconsistent state
- The "transaction is aborted" error is eliminated

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:
1. Running the seeding command: `python scripts/seed_database.py seed`
2. Ensuring it completes without transaction abort errors
3. Verifying that retries work correctly after partial failures
