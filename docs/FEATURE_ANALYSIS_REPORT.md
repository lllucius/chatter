**Code Pattern:**
```python
async def _get_cache_performance(self) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Get current cache performance metrics."""
    try:
        # Check if cache has performance stats
        if hasattr(self.cache, 'get_stats'):
            return self.cache.get_stats()
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting cache performance: {e}")
        return None
```

**Impact:**
