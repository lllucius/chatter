**Status:** Week 1 COMPLETE âœ… | Week 2 COMPLETE âœ… | Week 3 COMPLETE âœ… | Week 4 IN PROGRESS

### Week 1: Core Pipeline Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE

**Completed:** January 2025

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/base.py` (350+ lines)
  - WorkflowPipeline - Main orchestrator
  - Middleware protocol - Pluggable middleware interface
  - Executor protocol - Execution strategy interface
  - ExecutionContext - Standardized context with builder
  - ExecutionResult - Standardized result format

- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/executors.py` (100+ lines)
  - LangGraphExecutor - Primary executor
  - SimpleExecutor - Future simple executor
  - ParallelExecutor - Future parallel executor

- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/__init__.py` - Package exports

- âœ… `tests/core/pipeline/test_base.py` (300+ lines)
  - 11 comprehensive tests
  - Builder pattern tests
  - Middleware chain tests
  - Error handling tests

**Impact:**
- Lines added: ~800 (infrastructure + tests)
- Architecture: Procedural â†’ Pipeline-based
- Extensibility: Infinite via middleware
- Testability: Excellent (isolated components)

**Key Achievement:**
Replaced hard-coded procedural execution with composable middleware pipeline:
```python
pipeline = (
    WorkflowPipeline(LangGraphExecutor())
    .use(MonitoringMiddleware())
    .use(CachingMiddleware())
    .use(RetryMiddleware())
)
```

### Week 2: Built-in Middleware âœ… COMPLETE

**Completed:** January 2025

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/monitoring.py` (200 lines)
  - Integrates with unified event system from Phase 2
  - Publishes lifecycle events (STARTED, COMPLETED, FAILED)
  - Tracks execution time automatically
  - Emits resource loading events
  
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/caching.py` (200 lines)
  - Result caching to avoid redundant executions
  - Generates cache keys from workflow + context
  - Supports TTL and pluggable backends
  
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/retry.py` (150 lines)
  - Automatic retry logic for transient failures
  - Configurable retry count and exponential backoff
  - Retryable exception filtering
  
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/validation.py` (180 lines)
  - Input/output validation
  - Strict mode for warnings
  - Extensible validation rules
  
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/rate_limiting.py` (150 lines)
  - Request rate limiting per user or global
  - Sliding window algorithm
  - RateLimitExceeded exceptions

**Impact:**
- Lines added: ~880 (5 middleware implementations)
- Modularity: Each middleware single responsibility
- Composability: Mix and match as needed
- Integration: Seamless with Phase 2 event system

**Key Achievement:**
Complete middleware system enabling cross-cutting concerns:
```python
pipeline = (
    WorkflowPipeline(LangGraphExecutor())
    .use(MonitoringMiddleware())
    .use(CachingMiddleware(ttl_seconds=3600))
    .use(RetryMiddleware(max_retries=3))
    .use(ValidationMiddleware())
    .use(RateLimitingMiddleware(max_requests=60))
)
```

### Week 3: Strategy-Based Executor âœ… COMPLETE

**Completed:** January 2025

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… Enhanced `chatter/core/pipeline/executors.py` (210 lines)
  - LangGraphExecutor - Production-ready (existing)
  - SimpleExecutor - Lightweight sequential execution (NEW)
  - ParallelExecutor - Concurrent execution with batching (NEW)
  
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/executor_factory.py` (250 lines)
  - ExecutorFactory - Factory pattern for executor creation
  - ExecutorType enum - LANGGRAPH, SIMPLE, PARALLEL, AUTO
  - Auto-detection of best executor for workflow
  - Custom executor registration
  - Concurrency estimation

- âœ… Updated `chatter/core/pipeline/__init__.py` - Added factory exports

**Impact:**
- Lines added: ~410 (executor implementations + factory)
- Strategy pattern: Easy to add new executors
- Auto-detection: Smart executor selection
- Performance: Parallel execution for suitable workflows

**Key Achievement:**
Complete executor system with factory pattern:
```python
# Type-based creation
executor = create_executor(ExecutorType.PARALLEL, max_concurrent=5)

# Auto-detection
executor = create_executor_for_workflow(workflow)

# Custom registration
factory.register("custom", MyCustomExecutor)
```
