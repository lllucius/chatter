# Phase 3 Implementation Progress

**Status:** IN PROGRESS ðŸš€  
**Started:** January 2025  
**Current:** Month 1 Week 1 COMPLETE âœ…  
**Timeline:** 6 months (January - July 2025)

---

## Month 1: Execution Engine Redesign

**Goal:** Pipeline architecture with pluggable middleware  
**Status:** Week 1 COMPLETE âœ… | Weeks 2-4 IN PROGRESS

### Week 1: Core Pipeline Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE

**Completed:** January 2025

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/base.py` (350+ lines)
  - WorkflowPipeline - Main orchestrator
  - Middleware protocol - Pluggable middleware interface
  - Executor protocol - Execution strategy interface
  - ExecutionContext - Standardized context with builder
  - ExecutionResult - Standardized result format

- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/executors.py` (100+ lines)
  - LangGraphExecutor - Primary executor
  - SimpleExecutor - Future simple executor
  - ParallelExecutor - Future parallel executor

- âœ… `chatter/core/pipeline/__init__.py` - Package exports

- âœ… `tests/core/pipeline/test_base.py` (300+ lines)
  - 11 comprehensive tests
  - Builder pattern tests
  - Middleware chain tests
  - Error handling tests

**Impact:**
- Lines added: ~800 (infrastructure + tests)
- Architecture: Procedural â†’ Pipeline-based
- Extensibility: Infinite via middleware
- Testability: Excellent (isolated components)

**Key Achievement:**
Replaced hard-coded procedural execution with composable middleware pipeline:
```python
pipeline = (
    WorkflowPipeline(LangGraphExecutor())
    .use(MonitoringMiddleware())
    .use(CachingMiddleware())
    .use(RetryMiddleware())
)
```

### Week 2: Built-in Middleware (NEXT)

**Plan:**
- [ ] MonitoringMiddleware - Event publishing
- [ ] CachingMiddleware - Result caching
- [ ] RetryMiddleware - Automatic retry logic
- [ ] ValidationMiddleware - Input/output validation
- [ ] RateLimitingMiddleware - Request rate limiting

**Files to Create:**
- `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/__init__.py`
- `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/monitoring.py`
- `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/caching.py`
- `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/retry.py`
- `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/validation.py`
- `chatter/core/pipeline/middleware/rate_limiting.py`
- `tests/core/pipeline/middleware/test_monitoring.py`
- `tests/core/pipeline/middleware/test_caching.py`
- `tests/core/pipeline/middleware/test_retry.py`
- `tests/core/pipeline/middleware/test_validation.py`
- `tests/core/pipeline/middleware/test_rate_limiting.py`

**Estimated Impact:**
- Lines added: ~1,200 (5 middleware Ã— 80 lines + tests)
- Consolidation: Replace scattered monitoring/caching/retry code
- Reusability: Middleware can be mixed and matched

### Week 3: Strategy-Based Executor (PLANNED)

**Plan:**
- [ ] Enhance LangGraphExecutor
- [ ] Implement SimpleExecutor for lightweight workflows
- [ ] Design ParallelExecutor architecture
- [ ] Create executor factory/registry

**Files to Update/Create:**
- Update `chatter/core/pipeline/executors.py`
- Add `chatter/core/pipeline/executor_factory.py`
- Add tests for each executor

### Week 4: Integration & Migration (PLANNED)

**Plan:**
- [ ] Update UnifiedWorkflowExecutionService to use pipeline
- [ ] Migrate existing middleware (monitoring, error handling)
- [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**Files to Update:**
- `chatter/services/unified_workflow_execution.py`
- Add migration documentation
- Update integration tests
