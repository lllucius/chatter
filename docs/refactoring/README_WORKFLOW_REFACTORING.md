## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not do this incrementally?
**A**: The issues are deeply interconnected. Fixing one without the others provides minimal benefit and increases complexity. A comprehensive refactor is the most efficient approach.

### Q: Can we keep backward compatibility?
**A**: Not recommended. The old and new systems would need to coexist, doubling maintenance burden. Per requirements, backward compatibility is not needed.

### Q: What if we need to rollback?
**A**: We have database migration rollback scripts and can revert the PR. The staging environment will catch major issues before production.

### Q: How will this affect ongoing development?
**A**: Feature freeze on workflow system during refactor (4 weeks). Other systems can continue development.

### Q: What about external API users?
**A**: Provide 2-week notice, migration guide, and updated SDKs. Most users use SDKs which will be updated automatically.
