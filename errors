# SSE JSON Parsing Errors - RESOLVED

The JSON parsing errors in Server-Sent Events (SSE) handling have been fixed.

## Original Issues:
- SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'd', "data: {"ty"... is not valid JSON
- Occurred in useWorkflowChat.sendWorkflowMessage and ChatPage.handleWorkflowStreamingResponse

## Root Causes Fixed:
1. **Inconsistent data trimming**: One SSE parser used `.trim()`, the other didn't
2. **Missing buffering**: Incomplete SSE lines split across chunks caused "data: data: {" patterns

## Changes Applied:
1. Added `.trim()` to ensure consistent SSE data extraction
2. Added proper buffering to prevent line corruption in workflow streaming
3. Both streaming functions now use identical, robust SSE parsing pattern

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
These errors should no longer occur with the implemented fixes.
