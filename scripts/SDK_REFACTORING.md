# SDK Generation Scripts Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring of the SDK generation scripts to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and ensure valid SDKs are generated.

## Overview

The original SDK generation scripts had several issues:
- Code duplication between `generate_sdk.py`, `generate_ts.py`, and `generate_all.py`
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Mixed responsibilities (documentation vs SDK generation)
- No validation of generated SDKs
- Hardcoded configuration scattered across files
- No graceful handling of missing dependencies

## Refactored Architecture

### New Structure

```

│   ├── config.py          # Centralized configuration management
│   ├── files.py           # File and directory utilities
│   └── subprocess.py      # Process execution utilities
├── sdk/

│   └── generate_ts.py
├── generate_all.py        # Refactored main workflow script

└── generate_openapi.py    # Unchanged
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Utilities Module (`scripts/utils/`)

**`config.py`**
- Centralized configuration management with dataclasses
- Type-safe configuration objects for Python and TypeScript SDKs
- Default configuration factories
- OpenAPI generator configuration conversion

**`subprocess.py`**
- Common subprocess execution with consistent error handling
- Dependency checking functionality
- Process timeout and error management
- Command availability verification

**`files.py`**
- File and directory utilities
- JSON/text file operations
- SDK validation helpers
- Temporary file cleanup

#### 2. SDK Generation Module (`scripts/sdk/`)

**`base.py`**
- Abstract base class `SDKGenerator` with common functionality
- Template method pattern for SDK generation workflow
- Mock OpenAPI spec for testing
- Common temporary file management

**`python_sdk.py`**
- Specialized Python SDK generator
- Supports both `openapi-python-client` and `openapi-generator-cli`
- Mock SDK generation when tools are unavailable
- Python syntax validation

**`typescript_sdk.py`**
- Specialized TypeScript SDK generator
- Uses `openapi-generator-cli` with `typescript-axios` generator
- Mock SDK generation when tools are unavailable
- TypeScript syntax validation (when tsc is available)

#### 3. Main Scripts

**`generate_all.py`**
- Refactored with improved separation of concerns
- Modular approach using the new SDK generators
- Better error reporting and summary
- Additional command-line options (e.g., `--python-only`)

**`generate_sdk.py` and `generate_ts.py`**
- Simplified wrappers around the modular generators
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Clean, focused implementations

## Key Improvements

### 1. Eliminated Code Duplication
- Common functionality extracted into reusable utilities
- Shared configuration management
- Common error handling patterns

### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- Consistent exception types and handling
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are missing
- Detailed error reporting with actionable messages

### 3. Better Separation of Concerns
- Clear separation between documentation and SDK generation
- Modular architecture allows independent testing and development
- Single responsibility principle applied throughout

### 4. Graceful Dependency Handling
- Automatic detection of required tools
- Fallback to mock SDK generation for testing
- Clear installation instructions when tools are missing

### 5. Improved Configuration Management
- Type-safe configuration objects
- Centralized default values
- Easy customization and extension

### 6. Added Validation
- Generated SDKs are validated for completeness
- Syntax validation when compilers are available
- File existence and structure verification

### 7. Enhanced Testing
- Mock implementations allow testing without full backend
- Isolated unit testing of individual components
- Dependency injection for better testability

## Usage

### Individual SDK Generation

```bash
# Generate Python SDK only
python scripts/generate_sdk.py

# Generate TypeScript SDK only
python scripts/generate_ts.py
```

### Combined Workflow

```bash
# Generate everything (docs + both SDKs)
python scripts/generate_all.py

# Generate only Python SDK
python scripts/generate_all.py --python-only

# Generate only TypeScript SDK
python scripts/generate_all.py --ts-only

# Generate only documentation
python scripts/generate_all.py --docs-only

# Clean output directories first
python scripts/generate_all.py --clean
```

## Dependency Requirements

### For Full Generation
- `openapi-generator-cli` (for TypeScript SDK)
- `openapi-python-client` or `openapi-generator-cli` (for Python SDK)
- Backend dependencies for OpenAPI spec generation

### For Testing/Mock Generation
- No external dependencies required
- Scripts will create minimal mock SDKs for testing

## Mock SDK Generation

When the required tools are not available, the scripts automatically create minimal mock SDKs that:
- Have the correct file structure
- Include basic API functionality
- Pass validation checks
- Allow frontend/backend integration testing

### Mock Python SDK Features
- Basic client with health check endpoint
- Async/await support with aiohttp
- Type hints and dataclasses
- Package structure suitable for pip installation

### Mock TypeScript SDK Features
- Axios-based HTTP client
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Configuration management
- Basic API endpoint implementation

## Migration from Original Scripts

The refactored scripts maintain backward compatibility with the original interfaces. Existing CI/CD pipelines and automation should continue to work without modification.

Original scripts are preserved in `scripts/backup/` for reference and rollback if needed.

## Testing Results

The refactored scripts have been tested and show:
- ✅ Successful Python SDK generation (with mock fallback)
- ✅ Successful TypeScript SDK generation (with mock fallback)
- ✅ Proper validation of generated files
- ✅ Consistent error handling and reporting
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing workflows

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture enables easy future enhancements:
- Additional SDK languages (Go, Rust, etc.)
- Different OpenAPI generators
- Custom validation rules
- Integration with CI/CD systems
- Automated testing of generated SDKs
