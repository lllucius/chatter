  - title: "Profile Customization Guide"
    description: "Conversation explaining how to customize AI behavior"
    messages:
      - role: "USER"
        content: "I noticed there are different chat profiles. How do they work?"
      - role: "ASSISTANT"
        content: |
          Great question! Chat profiles let you customize my behavior for different types of tasks. Think of them as different "modes" I can operate in:

          **üéØ Available Profiles:**

          **Deterministic/Factual Mode** (Temperature: 0.1)
          - Best for: Research, fact-checking, technical documentation
          - Behavior: Precise, consistent, focused on accuracy

          **Creative Writing Mode** (Temperature: 0.9)
          - Best for: Brainstorming, creative writing, idea generation
          - Behavior: Imaginative, diverse, experimental approaches

          **Balanced Mode** (Temperature: 0.7)
          - Best for: General conversations, mixed tasks
          - Behavior: Flexible balance of creativity and accuracy

          **üîß Customization Options:**
          - Temperature (creativity vs consistency)
          - Response length limits
          - Specialized system prompts
          - Model selection (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

          **üí° Usage Tips:**
          - Switch profiles based on your current task
          - Create custom profiles for repeated workflows
          - Combine profiles with prompt templates for powerful automation

          Which type of task are you working on? I can recommend the best profile!
      - role: "USER"
        content: "I'm working on a technical specification document. Which profile would be best?"
      - role: "ASSISTANT"
        content: |
          Perfect! For technical specification documents, I'd recommend the **Deterministic/Factual Mode**. Here's why:

          **‚úÖ Why This Profile Works Best:**
          - **Low temperature (0.1)** ensures consistent, precise language
          - **Analytical focus** aligns with technical requirements
          - **Factual emphasis** reduces creative interpretations
          - **Structured responses** match technical documentation needs

          **üìã Ideal for Technical Specs:**
          - Requirements documentation
          - API specifications
          - System architecture descriptions
          - Technical procedures and protocols
          - Integration guidelines

          **üéØ You might also want to use:**
          - **"Code Review Template"** for technical accuracy
          - **"Document Summary Template"** for executive summaries
          - **Custom prompts** for your specific technical domain

          **üí° Pro Tip:** You can switch between profiles during our conversation! Start with Deterministic mode for the technical content, then switch to Balanced mode if you need help with presentation or stakeholder communication.

          Would you like me to switch to Deterministic mode now, or do you have questions about creating a custom profile for your specific technical domain?

      )

      for result in results:
          print(f"Match: {result.content}")
      ```

      ## Best Practices

      ### Performance
      - Use pagination for large result sets
      - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
      - Cache frequently accessed data
      - Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates

      ### Security
      - Store API keys securely (environment variables, secrets management)
      - Validate webhook signatures
      - Use HTTPS for all API calls
      - Implement proper access controls

      ### Integration
      - Start with small, focused integrations
      - Test thoroughly in development environment
      - Monitor API usage and performance
      - Keep SDKs and libraries up to date
