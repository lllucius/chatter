## Complexity Assessment

The workflow editor now supports workflows ranging from simple (2-3 nodes) to highly complex (50+ nodes with loops, variables, and error handling). The complexity scoring system helps users understand and optimize their workflows.

### Complexity Factors
- **Base complexity**: 2 points per node, 1 point per edge
- **Node-specific complexity**: 
  - Conditional: +5 points
  - Loop: +8 points  
  - Error Handler: +3 points
  - Tool: +2 points per tool configured
- **Thresholds**: Low (<20), Medium (20-50), High (50+)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

While the current implementation is fairly advanced, there are additional features that could be considered for future development:

### Advanced Features (Not Implemented)
- **Sub-workflow support** - Nested workflow components
- **Visual debugging** - Step-through execution with highlights
- **Performance profiling** - Actual execution time analysis
- **Custom node creation** - User-defined node types with custom logic
- **Version control** - Workflow change tracking and branching
- **Export formats** - PNG, SVG, PDF export capabilities
- **Collaboration features** - Multi-user editing and comments

### Integration Enhancements
